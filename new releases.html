                    <p>It's no secret that HTC has had a rough go of it for the past few years, despite offering solid flagship devices renowned for their beautiful design, build quality, and fantastic audio experience. With that said, it unfortunately has been a case of "more of the same" when it comes to the company's flagships, which is one of the reasons for their lackluster performance in the market.</p>
                            
                    <p>Launched back in January at CES. With the high-end offering, called the U Ultra, HTC has changed things up by not only releasing a high-end smartphone much earlier than usual, but also by completely revamping the design and build quality, along with new features like a secondary display. HTC has a lot riding on the success of this device, but does it deliver? </p>
                            
                    <img class="phoneimages" src="img/htc%20u.jpg" alt="HTC U"/>
                            
                    <p>The phone comes with high-end specifications, a really eye catching design, and a solid camera, but the small battery and the lack of a headphone jack are questionable choices at best. It is also missing features that are becoming increasingly standard, like wireless charging and dust/water resistance. That would all be fine if not for the 750 Euro price tag that is extremely hard to justify, and makes the phone far less accessible to consumers. It is a price point that only diehard HTC fans would be willing to bear, and while this may the phone for U, it certainly isn't the one for me.</p>

                        <h1 class="apps">Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+</h1>  
                        <p>Price 800-899 Euro</p>

                        <p>If you decide to buy the Samsung Galaxy S8, you will get the best display ever made for a smartphone, at least for now. That's the verdict, at least, from the team at DisplayMate, which has been making thorough examinations of smartphone and tablet displays for many years.</p>
                            
                        <p>Along with its yearly hardware refresh, Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus have brought us the company's latest software endeavour and likely major player in the smart assistant space, Bixby. The system is a marked improvement on the old S Voice and has the impressive Google Assistant firmly in its sights.</p>
                            
                         <img class="phoneimages" src="img/s8.jpg" alt="HTC U"/>   

                        <p>Samsung calls Bixby a "multi-nodal intelligent service", by which the company means that its assistant works not just with voice, but with text and camera inputs too. One of Samsung's goals has been to ensure that touch and voice controls can achieve the same results.</p>

                        <h1 class="apps">LG G6</h1>  
                        <p>Price 799 Euro</p>

                        <div class="phonecontent">   
                        <p>Last year saw LG bring us the LG G5, a handset that dared to be different and failed spectacularly in doing so. This resulted in losses for the company's mobile division in 2015, and lost market share as Samsung extended its lead and Huawei caught up and overtook the Korean manufacturer.</p>
                         
                        <img class="phoneimages" src="img/lg%20g6.jpg" alt="Lg G6" /> 
                          
                           
                        
                        <p>There is one way the LG G6 is different; its 5.7-inch screen with a unique 18:9 aspect ratio. With other phones expected to also offer the same aspect ratio display later this year, the G6 could prove to be a forward-thinking phone rather than yet another one-hit wonder from LG.</p>   
                            
                        <p>Simply put, LG's G6 represents the future of what we should expect from a flagship smartphone.</p>
